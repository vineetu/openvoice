/// Phase 1.6 acceptance: drive `JotHarness.askJotVoice(...)` end-to-end
/// through the live `ChatbotVoiceInput` graph.
///
/// Three tests:
/// 1. **Happy path** — condensation completes, `result.condensed`
///    carries the canned output, `condensationTaskWasCancelled == false`.
/// 2. **Short-input skip** (spec §8) — transcripts with <15 words
///    bypass condensation; the `StubCondenser`'s `condense(raw:)` is
///    never invoked.
/// 3. **I1 regression** — `withKnownIssue` wrapper. The
///    `StubCondenser` sleeps 5 seconds; cancel-during-condensation
///    should propagate immediately and outcome should land
///    `.cancelled`. Today the bug at
///    `Sources/AskJot/ChatbotVoiceInput.swift:229` (the inline
///    `await Self.condenseIfEligible(...)` call is never wrapped in
///    a Task and never assigned to `condensationTask`) means
///    `cancel()` is a silent no-op. Outcome stays nil at the 500ms
///    observation window. Phase 2 fix (capture the Task, propagate
///    cancellation) flips the outcome to `.cancelled` within ms.
///
/// `.serialized` because the suite shares process-global state
/// (`@AppStorage` keys, `StubURLProtocol.pending`,
/// `FirstRunState.shared`) with other harness suites. Same rationale
/// as `RewriteFlowTests`.
