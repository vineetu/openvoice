///   * `id` — slug matching `Feature.bySlug(_:)`.
///   * `title` — user-facing headline.
///   * `badge` — short monospaced category.
///   * `body` — problem description and fix, kept within a reasonable prose
///     budget (single sentence to a few sentences max — some migrated cards
///     from the old HelpPane carry longer diagnostic detail by design).
///   * `expansionProse` — optional longer-form guidance revealed on tap.
///   * `illustration` — a `@ViewBuilder` closure producing the card's SF
///     Symbol composition.
///
/// Text is preserved verbatim from the old `HelpPane.swift` catalog for the
/// 8 migrated cards so we don't lose the carefully-worded diagnostic detail.
/// The 3 new AI cards use the exact body copy from spec §7.
