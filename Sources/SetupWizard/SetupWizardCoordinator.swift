/// Orchestrates the setup wizard's step pointer and footer state.
///
/// Step views hold their own local state (picked model, selected device,
/// download progress, recorded transcript); the coordinator owns the
/// **persistent** step-precondition rules (`canAdvance(from:given:)`) and
/// the chrome (`setChrome(_:)`).
///
/// Phase 3 #31: gating rules previously lived inside view-body
/// `updateChrome()` calls and the harness mirrored them inline in
/// `JotHarness+Wizard.canAdvance(from:grants:)`. Two parallel switch
/// statements drift silently when a step's rule changes. The rules now
/// live on this type; views call `coordinator.canAdvance(...)` to
/// derive `WizardStepChrome.canAdvance` (AND-combining with their own
/// view-only ephemeral state where needed), and the harness calls the
/// same function — no mirror.
///
/// `advance(given:)` consults the precondition before bumping the
/// pointer; `back()` is unconditional; `skip()` deliberately bypasses
/// the precondition (that's what "skip" means).
