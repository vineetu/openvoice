///   * `transform(...)` — Cleanup tail. Used by `RecorderController` to
///     post-process raw dictation transcripts.
///   * `rewrite(...)` — Selection rewrite. Used by
///     `RewriteController` for both Rewrite with Voice (voice instruction)
///     and Rewrite (`"Rewrite this"`) flows.
///   * `streamChat(...)` — Ask Jot conversational streaming. Used by
///     `HelpChatStore.send`. Returns an `AsyncThrowingStream<String, Error>`
///     of token deltas; provider-specific errors (e.g.
///     `LanguageModelSession.GenerationError`) propagate verbatim
///     through the stream's error channel so consumers can switch on
///     the original type without relying on a translated enum.
///

/// are `Sendable`. Cancellation propagates through `Task.cancel()` —
