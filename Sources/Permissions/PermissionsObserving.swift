/// OS-boundary seam for the macOS permission grant matrix (Microphone,
/// Input Monitoring, Accessibility post-events, Accessibility full AX).
/// The live conformer is `PermissionsService` (kept as a singleton per
/// `cleanup-roadmap.md` Phase 3 allowlist — tier-2 platform-bound);
/// harness conformers in `Tests/JotHarness/` return canned grant maps
/// so flow tests can exercise both the granted and denied paths without
/// poking System Settings.
///
/// The shape mirrors `PermissionsService`'s existing public surface so
/// the operational call sites (`DeliveryService`, `RewriteController`,
/// `VoiceInputPipeline`) can swap to the protocol with a one-line type
/// change.
///
/// **Capability vs. PermissionKind:** the brief said `PermissionKind` but
/// the existing codebase has used `Capability` (`Sources/Permissions/Capability.swift`)
/// since v1.4. Renaming would touch every Settings, Wizard, and Help
/// surface — out of scope for a Phase 0 seam. The seam uses `Capability`
/// to match the existing taxonomy.
///
/// `@MainActor` because every operational consumer is `@MainActor`-isolated
/// and `PermissionsService` itself is `@MainActor`. `AnyObject & Sendable`
/// lets `any PermissionsObserving` round-trip through `AppServices`
/// without warnings.
