import Combine

/// Bridges `RecorderController` state transitions and `lastResult` emissions
/// into `SoundPlayer` calls. Owned by `AppDelegate` for the app lifetime.
///
/// State-transition mapping:
///   `.idle → .recording`            → `recordingStart`
///   `.recording → .idle`            → `recordingCancel` (user aborted; no
///                                     transcription ran)
///   `.recording → .transcribing`    → `recordingStop`
///   `anything → .error(_)`          → `error`
///
/// The `transcriptionComplete` chime rides on `$lastResult` — that publisher
/// fires exactly once per successful transcription, which is what we want.
/// Playing it on `.transcribing → .idle` would also double-fire alongside
/// `lastResult` and a user-facing "error → idle" recovery.
///
/// The initial `.idle` value Combine replays on `.sink` is intentionally
/// swallowed (see `previousState`) so the app doesn't chirp on launch.
