/// MainActor-isolated singleton owning the `@Published` streaming
/// partial transcript that the recording pill reads.
///
/// Why a singleton: partials are emitted from `StreamingTranscriber`
/// (an actor that lives inside `DualPipelineTranscriber`), need to
/// reach `PillViewModel` (a MainActor `ObservableObject`), and apply
/// uniformly to every voice-capture site (Dictation, Articulate
/// voice-instruction, Ask Jot voice input). A shared store with
/// session bracketing keeps the pill subscriber and the streaming
/// engine from inventing parallel session-id spaces — the pipeline's
/// own `Token.generation` is the only authority.
///
/// Lifecycle (per §4.3, §8.5 of the streaming-option plan):
/// 1. `VoiceInputPipeline.startRecording` mints a `Token` with a
///    monotonically-increasing `generation` and immediately calls
///    `beginSession(token:)`.
/// 2. The streaming engine's `onPartial` callback funnels each new
///    transcript snapshot through `publish(_:token:)`.
/// 3. `endSession()` runs from `stopAndTranscribe` / `cancel`. It
///    clears `partial` to `nil`, which triggers the pill to drop
///    back to its non-streaming compact width.
///
/// Stale-token gate: `publish(_:token:)` ignores callbacks whose
/// generation doesn't match the current session. Without the gate, a
/// late callback from a just-finished engine could overwrite a fresh
/// session's partial with stale text.
