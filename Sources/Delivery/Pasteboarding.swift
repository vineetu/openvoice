/// OS-boundary seam for the system pasteboard. The live conformer is
/// `LivePasteboard` (wraps `NSPasteboard.general` via `ClipboardSandwich`'s
/// existing snapshot/write/restore implementation); harness conformers in
/// `Tests/JotHarness/` keep an in-memory store so flow tests can verify
/// pasteboard state without affecting the developer's real clipboard.
///
/// Methods mirror the operations the live recording / rewrite paths
/// already perform:
/// - `snapshot()` captures current pasteboard contents (per-type data)
///   so the clipboard-sandwich can roll back after a synthetic ⌘V.
/// - `write(_:)` clears + sets the pasteboard string. `@discardableResult
///   Bool` preserves the failure-detection path that DeliveryService and
///   RewriteController already act on.
/// - `restore(_:)` writes a snapshot back, used by both the auto-paste
///   delay-restore and the Rewrite selection-capture flow.
/// - `changeCount` exposes `NSPasteboard.changeCount` because
///   RewriteController.captureSelection compares before/after to detect
///   whether the synthetic ⌘C actually moved data onto the pasteboard.
/// - `readString()` exposes `NSPasteboard.string(forType: .string)` for the
///   same Rewrite flow.
///
/// All operations are `@MainActor`-isolated because `NSPasteboard` and the
/// existing `ClipboardSandwich` helpers are MainActor-bound, and the only
/// consumers (`DeliveryService`, `RewriteController`) are themselves
/// `@MainActor`. `Sendable` so `any Pasteboarding` round-trips through
/// `AppServices` without warnings.
