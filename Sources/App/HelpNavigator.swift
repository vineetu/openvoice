/// Event bus coordinating cross-pane navigation. Owned at the root of
/// the unified window so every pane can read and write it, and so
/// mid-flight deep-links survive sidebar navigation.
///
/// Consumers:
///   * `HelpPane` — reads `switchTab`, `pendingExpansion`,
///     `highlightedFeatureId` to drive the two-phase deep-link
///     (expand → scroll → highlight pulse).
///   * Settings panes — read `pendingSettingsFieldAnchor` to scroll
///     a just-opened Settings subsection to a specific field row.
///   * `JotAppWindow` — observes `sidebarSelection` to switch the
///     active pane (Home / Ask Jot / Settings / Help / About).
///   * `AskJotView` — reads `pendingPrefill` + `focusChatInput` to
///     wire the sparkle-icon / About-row → TextField prefill path.
///   * `InfoPopoverButton` (legacy) — continues posting the
///     `jot.help.scrollToAnchor` notification until phase 2C migrates
///     anchor strings to slugs. `HelpPane` bridges the old notification
///     into a tab-level fallback so deep-links still land somewhere
///     non-broken during the transition.
///
/// The navigator is a plain `@Observable` view model — no Combine, no
/// ObservableObject — so SwiftUI tracks property-level access
/// automatically. Mutating a property from the main actor is sufficient
/// to trigger a view update.
