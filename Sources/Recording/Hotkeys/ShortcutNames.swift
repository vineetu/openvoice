import KeyboardShortcuts

/// Canonical names for every global shortcut Jot registers. Declared in one
/// place so `HotkeyRouter`, the Settings pane, and the Setup Wizard all
/// refer to the same identities.
///
/// Defaults match the feature inventory:
///   - toggleRecording: ⌥Space (always-on)
///   - cancelRecording: Esc with no modifiers (dynamic — only active while
///     a cancellable pipeline is running). NOT shown in Settings — treated
///     as a hardcoded key the user can't rebind.
///   - pushToTalk: unbound by default (user opts in from Settings)
///   - pasteLastTranscription: ⌥,
///   - rewriteWithVoice: ⌥. (v1.4 introduced this binding under raw-value
///     storage key `"rewriteSelection"`; v1.6 carried that key forward
///     under the new Swift symbol so user-customized bindings survive
///     every Swift-level rename. Only the Swift symbol moved.)
///   - rewrite: ⌥/ — v1.5 addition. Same selection → LLM → paste pipeline
///     as `rewriteWithVoice`, but with a hardcoded instruction string and
///     no voice step. The KeyboardShortcuts raw-value storage key remains
///     stable across renames so any v1.5 user-customized binding survives.
